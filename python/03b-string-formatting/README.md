This section has a funny name because I wanted to be
able to explain how the formatting of strings and output
works in Python, but I had already set up the numbering
for the Ruby examples.

I will look up how the string formatting works in Ruby,
and then maybe we can re-number everything so that it
all makes sense -- for now I wanted to be sure that
the sequence was the same in both, in case people want
to compare across the two examples.
