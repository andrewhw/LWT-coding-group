This is a bit of a more complicated example.  It is in three
parts:

1. "minibar_list" puts a list of three drinks together into an
	array and prints them out

2. "minibar_hash_name" puts the same three drinks into a "Hash"
	using the name of the drink as a key

3. "minibar_hash_ingredient" uses each of the ingredients as a
	key as well


The next example (in group 05) follows on this pattern, but uses
keyboard input to make things more interactive (and useful!)
